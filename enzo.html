More and more workers express the desire to be able to work from home several days a week. It is to respond to this societal trend that I designed the Enzo desk. I wanted to create a desk that was very functional but yet very elegant and which was not just a useful piece of furniture. It is a desk that we highlight in our living room and not that we hide in our bedroom. The office is a piece of furniture that is making a comeback in our interiors due to the democratization of teleworking. More and more workers express the desire to be able to work from home several days a week. It is to respond to this societal trend that I designed the Eloi desk.
